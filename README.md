# TECHATHON 2025
TechAthon 2025 is a hackathon at my unniversity, were contestants had 45 hours to "hack" a given case, in a cross disciplinary competition with both computer engineers, sustainable design engineers, and landinspectors.
Our case was "flood prevention and rain water collection" where we ended up concluding we couldn't really do anything for the flod, as ground water was the issue
We therefore focused our energy on a reverse umbrella that would automatically deploy when raining, collect water into a storage system, and then retract back when the rain cleared to avoid contaminating the surroundings with something of questionable architectural astthetics
